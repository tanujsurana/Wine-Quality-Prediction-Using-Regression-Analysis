# Wine Quality Prediction Using Regression Analysis

This project uses machine learning regression models to predict the quality of red and white wines based on various physicochemical properties. The dataset contains features such as acidity, sugar, pH, and alcohol content that influence wine quality.

## 📊 Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for red and white wine datasets
- Implementation of Linear Regression, Ridge, and Lasso models
- Model comparison using R² score, RMSE, and visual plots
- Training and evaluation on both red and white wine datasets
- Output plots for prediction accuracy and feature influence

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib, seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code
